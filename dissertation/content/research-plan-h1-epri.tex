\section{EPRI \hone Study}
\label{chap:h1}

A selection of \J results from bending will be processed through the methods used in \Cref{sec:h1-verification} to examine the applicability of the EPRI estimation method.
Both Abaqus models with the fully-plastic check enabled and WARP3D models from the TASC bending database will be considered.
One advantage in the current research is that all models, whether solved with Abaqus or WARP3D, will use identical meshes, removing a possible source of error when comparing the two sets of results.
