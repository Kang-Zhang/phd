%\section{Development of Scripted Finite Element Models}

One disadvantage to the earlier finite element models is the difficulty in tracking changes to model input.
Most models are constructed interactively, which makes it difficult to isolate the critical differences between a working model and a non-working one.
Imagine having to click through every dialog box that could affect results, doing this on multiple models, and visually checking for differences in each of the material properties, boundary conditions, element types, etc.
In some cases, the user can write a plain-text file representing the model, but this can sometimes include lots of irrelevant information, or may simply contain a list of nodes and elements instead of driving variables such as mesh size parameters.

Details of the development of scripted finite element models are given in \Cref{chap:app-quillen-rework}, but the motivation can be summarized as a need to increase automation for parametric studies, to reduce opportunities for manual errors, to modularize and reduce duplicate code, and to improve tracking of changes made to models over time.
The resulting Python script was derived from an example given in the Abaqus~6.11-1 Benchmarks Manual \citeyearpar{abaqus-611-benchmarks-manual}, and can construct any of the tension models on demand, within a matter of seconds.

%Many finite element analysis software packages support the use of input files with a proprietary keyword syntax.
%Examples of this syntax include APDL (ANSYS parametric design language) and keyword syntax in Abaqus.
%Creating models with this method is more difficult for new users than with the graphical interactive method.
%However, since the keyword method is much closer to writing programs in a high-level programming language, it is much easier to isolate differences between models based off the differences in their input files.
%See \Cref{fig:material-apdl} for an example of a material property definition in APDL syntax, and \Cref{fig:material-abaqus-keyword} for the same material property definition in Abaqus keyword syntax.
%In both examples, the elastic modulus \(E\)\nomenclature[1E]{\(E\)}{elastic modulus} is defined on the first line, Poisson's ratio \(\nu\)\nomenclature[2\nu]{\(\nu\)}{Poisson's ratio} is defined on the second line, and both can be referenced wherever needed afterwards.

%Most finite element models are like that---they're constructed interactively, with a GUI, and when (not if) errors or glitches happen, it's difficult to identify their origin.

%Some models (often simpler 2D ones) are constructed in an input language for the finite element program.

%This is an improvement in terms of code verification, but isn't always easily applied to more complex models.

%Eric's models were constructed in a third-party program (FEA-Crack) and analyzed in Abaqus.
%
%\vfill
%
%By 2009, we no longer had a license to FEA-Crack, and renewing it was prohibitively expensive.
%
%\vfill
%
%Though FEA-Crack used Abaqus' input language syntax, it basically wrote out a giant list of nodes and elements, making it difficult to impossible to determine why his models had anomalies at the third node.

%One disadvantage to the APDL and Abaqus keyword languages is that both store all parameters in a single global scope.
%That is, they require any variable (for example, \verb|NU|) to have the same meaning at all places in the code, making it more difficult to describe a problem involving both Poisson's ratio (\( \nu \) in solid mechanics) and kinematic viscosity (\( \nu \) in fluid mechanics).
%Even if the variables were renamed to have distinct names (for example, \verb|PR| and \verb|KV|), the code would still require everyone using the set of code to agree on one set of names, making code sharing throughout a research community more difficult.

%
%Though the Python version of the material property definition is more verbose than either of the keyword versions of the definition, it is arguably more readable to an infrequent user.
%The code also demonstrates four valuable features of Python scripting: the ability to create user-defined functions, the existence of a local variable scope for functions (so that parameters are not defined in a global scope by default), the ability to pass named parameters to functions in any order, and the ability to have default values for any parameters not defined in the function call.
%
%The existence of functions is critical for a program to be easily maintained: if an error is found in a function, it can be corrected once, and that correction automatically propagates everywhere the function was used.
%If an error is found in an equation that has been copied and pasted repeatedly (due to a lack of functions in the language), the error must be corrected everywhere the equation exists.
%
%Local parameter scopes are very helpful: they remove the requirement that a variable name have one and only one meaning throughout a body of code, and throughout any code that will ever be used with it.
%Default values for parameters and the ability to use named parameters in any order are convenient.
%Both of these features enable a research community to coordinate on what set of parameters needs to be passed to a function, and what result that function returns, but places no restrictions on what the parameters or result should be named.
%This allows the research community to be more loosely coordinated, and for them to share code more easily with fewer modifications.

%Working from a basic Python program for elliptical surface cracks given in the Abaqus~6.11-1 Benchmarks Manual \citeyearpar{abaqus-611-benchmarks-manual}, a new program has been developed to reliably and repeatably analyze surface cracks in plates for any valid combination of plate geometry, crack geometry, material properties, and remote pressures.
%This program includes functions for:
%\begin{itemize}
%\item creation of plate geometry,
%\item creation of an elliptical path representing the crack front,
%\item sweeping two
%circular
%%square
%profiles along the elliptical path to create regions for singularity elements and transitional elements near the crack front,
%\item assembling the plate and swept profiles into a single assembly,
%\item partitioning the plate to enable focused hexahedral meshing throughout the plate,
%\item assignment of simple elastic or Ramberg-Osgood elastic-plastic material properties,
%\item creation of geometry sets for the traction surface, symmetry planes, and crack front,
%\item definition of contour integral \J along the crack front,
%\item assignment of mesh sizes (both default and exceptions along specific edges,
%\item meshing the model regions with singularity elements, transitional elements, or regular hexahedral elements,
%\item creation of load step and boundary conditions,
%\item creation of history output requests to track values along the crack front as appropriate (\J for elastic-plastic models; \J, \K and tangential stress for elastic models),
%\item creation of job input file,
%\item submission of input file for analysis,
%\item reading \J values from the resulting Abaqus output database (ODB)\nomenclature[1O]{ODB}{Abaqus output database},
%\item converting the \J values into \hone values analogous to those in \Cref{eq:h1mcclung}, and
%\item writing \hone values and crack node coordinates to a text file.

%\section{Further Updates to Quillen Abaqus Models}
%
\clearpage
Building from \citet{renfro2009}, the previously-described Python program created sets of models matching the plate and crack geometries given in \Cref{fig:geometries}.
For each of the nine geometries, finite element models with varying numbers of elements were created.
For each finite element mesh, one linear elastic and three Ramberg-Osgood elastic-plastic models were analyzed, and \J values were stored in the Abaqus ODB.
Finally, \hone values were calculated from the \J values to test for convergence and verification against earlier models.
A total of 144 models were analyzed, including 36 elastic models (nine geometries by four mesh densities) and 108 elastic-plastic models (nine geometries by four mesh densities by three Ramberg-Osgood hardening exponents).
Solving all the models required approximately 43 hours on one quad-core AMD Opteron compute cluster node, and created \SI{103}{\giga\byte} of output data. Extracting \hone data from the ODB files took only 7 minutes.
Mesh convergence for one model is shown in \Cref{fig:mesh-convergence}, and convergence on the ratio of \Jpl:\Jel is shown in \Cref{fig:j-convergence}.
Note that the mesh convergence is not due simply to creating smaller elements along the crack front.
As shown in \Cref{fig:model1-3-meshes}, the number of elements along the crack front only increases from 21 to 25.
Adding additional elements outside the crack region has an effect on the \J and \hone values calculated, indicating that this model set needs further development.
However, all three anomalous \hone results in \citet{quillen2005} have been eliminated, as shown in \Cref{fig:model1}.
The root cause of the anomalies (errors in the original files generated by FEACrack, possible unrecorded modifications to the files, bugs corrected in Abaqus, etc.) is still unknown.

\vfill

One was to determine the influence of mesh density on \J results.

\vfill

The other was to determine the how much plastic deformation was required to give converged \J values.

\vfill

By default, when Abaqus is doing a fully plastic analysis for \J, is applies load until the ratio of \Jpl to \Jel is 10:1.

\vfill

But moving from a 10:1 ratio to a 100:1 ratio yielded substantial \J and \hone differences deep in the crack.

\vfill

The 100:1 and 1000:1 ratios returned virtually identical results.
