	Abstract = {A Normalized Area-compliance method has been shown to be able to predict
	the depth of an elliptical surface crack in a cylindrical rod. The
	method involves a combination of optical surface crack length measurement
	and specimen compliance measurement. Finite element analysis was
	employed to show that the specimen compliance has a one-to-one correspondence
	with the Normalized Area (NA) or Normalized Harmonic Mean Radius
	(NHMR) independent of crack depth and crack aspect ratio and with
	the crack shape and specimen dimension for a range of crack and specimen
	dimensions. Based on the finite element analysis, master curves of
	Normalized Compliance versus Normalized Area have been generated
	for surface-cracked rod under tension with ends free or constrained
	from rotation. The accuracy of crack depth prediction using this
	method has been verified by fractography of fatigue cracked rods.
	Moreover, fatigue crack growth behaviour deduced from this crack
	depth measurement agrees well with the crack growth data obtained

	Abstract = {A study has been made of two different cracking techniques for obtaining
	partial-thickness cracks. These are the axial fatigue and the flexural
	fatigue methods. Both methods were found to yield a preferred propagation
	path (PPP) in the crack depth-crack half-length plane. The PPP is
	defined as the propagation path which the crack follows after the
	starter notch no longer influences it, and was markedly different
	for the two cracking techniques. The axial PPP was found to be a
	straight line with $a/c$ approximately equal to 0.9, where $a$ is
	crack depth and $c$ is crack half-length. The flexural PPP was found
	to be a curve that initially had a slope of $a/c = 1$, but as the
	crack depth increased, the change in crack depth with respect to

	Abstract = {Finite element technique has been widely used in 2-D fatigue crack
	closure problems for almost three decades. However, the reported
	3-D surface crack closure results obtained from this technique are
	scarce. One possible cause could be the meshing difficulty. In the
	present study, meshing issues are discussed. Subsequently, both semi-circular
	and semi-elliptical crack closure behaviors at various loading conditions
	are calculated. The calculated results show that the closure and
	opening phenomena of surface cracks are caused by two types of plastic
	wake, that is, the near-surface type and the interior region type.
	In the stress ratio $R=0$ cases, the final crack-front opening always
	takes place at the free surface. However, the calculated $R=-1$ results
	show a different crack opening sequence. In the semi-elliptical crack
	results, along the crack front, different opening levels are found

	Abstract = {Appendix A to Section XI of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code
	provides an analytical procedure for determining the acceptability
	of flaws that have been detected during in-service inspection of
	ferritic components. The procedure requires the evaluation of the
	end-of-period flaw size from a cumulative fatigue flaw growth analysis
	which is carried out by determining the range of the stress intensity
	factor associated with each transient and applying the result to
	the appropriate fatigue crack growth rate curve. The stress intensity
	factor calculation can be quite sensitive to the flaw shape which
	changes during flaw growth. The 1998 Edition of the Code specifies
	that flaw shape change should be accounted for but provides no guidance
	on how this is to be done. The inclusion of explicitly stated flaw
	shape change methodology eliminates a source of uncertainty in the
	flaw growth calculation. This paper reviews the literature on surface
	flaw shape changes due to cyclic loading with respect to both available
	test data and formulations that have been proposed to determine flaw
	shape change during growth. It then discusses those formulations
	that have been studied in some detail and evaluated for inclusion
	in Appendix A to Section XI. Comparisons of the computed shape change
	curves with experimental shape changes for several sets of data provide
	justification for incorporating two of these methods in Appendix
	A: (1) a linearized stress ratio approach based on use of the Paris
	formula for incremental flaw growth in the depth direction and a
	formulation for calculating flaw length and shape; and (2) a generalized
	stress approach based on use of the Paris formula for incremental
	flaw growth in both the depth and length directions. Environmental
	effects on flaw shape change, guidelines for numerical integration
	of the crack growth rate equations, and the applicability of the
	two recommended procedures are also discussed.},

	Abstract = {From previous results of fatigue crack growth and fracture toughness
	measurements for a Ni-Fe base superalloy, a primary candidate for
	the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) central
	solenoid (CS) conduit, we derive an improved magnet life analysis
	model from the framework of Newman and Raju. For the superalloy conduit
	with an initial semielliptical surface crack in its thickness direction,
	the model predicts the evolution of crack aspect ratio for a wide
	range of initial crack geometries under pure tension and bending
	fatigue. The prediction of final fracture due to fatigue crack growth
	using the linear elastic fracture mechanics approach is shown to
	be underconservative. An alternative model based on Newman's elastic-plastic
	fracture toughness parameter is derived for the base metal with nearly
	semicircular cracks. The improved life analysis model taking into
	account the fatigue and fracture behavior is applied to the ITER
	CS magnet and the results are compared with those from earlier models.
	Accounting for the crack shape evolution leads to significantly longer
	life compared to assuming a constant aspect ratio. For the superalloy
	base metal we find that the expected fatigue life of Engineering
	Design Activity (EDA) design of the CS magnet is about eight times
	the design requirement. Even the Conceptual Design Activity (CDA)
	design with a free-standing CS meets the life requirement when analyzed
	by the improved model.},

	in notched round bars. Both remote cyclic tension and bending loads
	are considered. Characteristics of the crack shape change are also
	investigated by examining deviations of the crack profiles from the
	widely assumed elliptical-arc shape, and aspect ratio changes with

	Abstract = {A multiple degree of freedom numerical procedure applicable to the

	under a combined tension and bending load is described. This procedure
	performs a three-dimensional finite element analysis to estimate
	the stress intensity factors at a set of points along the crack front,
	and then calculates the crack growth increments at these points invoking
	a fatigue crack growth relationship. A new crack front is established
	using a cubic spline approximation. A remeshing technique developed
	enables the procedure to be implemented automatically, and then fatigue
	crack growth can, therefore, be predicted in a step-by-step way.
	Following the descriptions of some theoretical background and technical
	details, several important problems in the evaluation of stress intensity
	factors by the finite element method are discussed. They include
	the sensitivity of stress intensity factor results to crack shape,
	the effect of mesh orthogonality and the $J$-integral path independence.
	It is shown that the stress intensity factor results are sensitive
	to the crack front shape, that the cubic spline approximation to
	a crack front can eliminate the oscillation of stress intensity factors
	around the crack front defined by the polygonal line and consequently
	increase the stress intensity factor accuracy, and that the $J$-integral

	Abstract = {This paper presents the results of a combined experimental and mechanistic
	modeling approach to the study of dwell fatigue in Ti-6242. Crack
	shape evolution, depth and surface crack growth rates are established
	using beachmarking, acoustic emission and scanning electron microscopy
	(SEM) techniques. The underlying crack nucleation and fatigue fracture
	modes are elucidated for three microstructures: equiaxed (microstructure
	1), elongated (microstructure 2) and colony (microstructure 3) of
	Ti-6242. The dominant crack nucleation mode is shown to involve a
	Stroh-type dislocation mechanism, where sub-surface cracks are characterized
	by prominent facetted fracture modes in the near-threshold regime.
	Subsequent fatigue crack growth occurs by fatigue striations and
	ductile dimples or cleavage-like static modes at higher stress intensity
	factor ranges. The long crack growth data are similar for both dwell
	and pure fatigue. However, the dwell fatigue crack growth rates are
	shown to be much greater than those due to pure fatigue in the short
	crack growth regime. The differences between the dwell crack growth
	rates and the pure fatigue crack growth rates in the short regime
	are attributed to possible creep effects that give rise to a mean
	stress effect in the case of dwell fatigue. Subsequently, the measured
	crack growth rates are incorporated into a fracture mechanics framework
	for the estimation of fatigue life in the three microstructures.
	The implications of the predictions are discussed for the modeling
	of dwell fatigue. \copyright 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {The contour $J$-integral values were calculated using the three-dimensional
	elastic-plastic finite element method for semielliptical surface
	cracks originated at notch roots under tensile loading. Then these
	were compared with the $J$-integral values calculated using the conventional
	equation we proposed in earlier papers, which we refer to as $J$
	hereafter. The difference between the two was quite small at the
	deepest point $A$ in the semielliptical surface crack, but was fairly
	large at the edge of a crack on the specimen surface, $C$. The conventional
	equation was modified by considering stress/strain gradients developed
	in the cross section at the notch root. The $J$-integral value calculated
	using the proposed equation, $J'$ was in quite good agreement with
	the contour $J$-integral value at both points, $A$ and $C$ in a semielliptical
	surface crack. The difference between the ratio $J/J'$ and 1.0 increased
	with increase in crack depth, depending upon the aspect ratio of
	the surface crack, magnitude of the applied stress and notch root
	radius. The parameter $R_w$ was proposed, so that $J/J'$ could be
	expressed by a unique curve as a function of $R_w$ over quite wide
	ranges of notch root radius, surface-crack shape and magnitude of
	stress. The application limit of the simple $J$-integral estimation
	proposed earlier was assessed using this curve. The crack growth
	rates obtained from fatigue tests of notched specimen were successfully
	plotted against $J$-integral range calculated using the modified
	conventional equation.},

	Abstract = {Linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM) is used when response to
	the load is elastic, and the fracture is brittle. For LEFM, the K-factor
	is the most commonly used fracture criterion. However, high temperatures
	and limited high stress cycles before component replacement are factors
	that can cause significant plastic deformation and a ductile failure.
	In these cases, an elastic-plastic fracture mechanics (EPFM) approach
	is required. The J-integral is commonly used as an EPFM fracture
	parameter.
	
	
	The primary goal of this research was to develop three-dimensional
	finite element analysis (FEA) J-integral data for surface crack specimen
	geometries and compare to existing solutions. The finite element
	models were analyzed as elastic, and fully plastic using ABAQUS.
	The J-integral data were used to find the load independent variable,
	h1 for comparison purposes. There were two other goals in this research.
	The second goal was to examine the effect of various finite element
	modelling parameters including mesh density, element type, symmetry,
	and specimen size effects, on the resulting J-integral. The third
	goal was to perform elastic-plastic finite element analyses that
	utilize a stress vs. plastic strain table based on a power law hardening
	material behavior. The elastic-plastic and fully plastic results
	were compared.
	
	
	For the most part, the current data compared well with the data published
	by other researchers. The elastic results compared more favorably
	than the fully plastic and elastic-plastic data. For both the elastic
	and plastic analyses, the finite element models (FEMs) produced sudden
	increases in the K-factor and J-integral at the free surface and/or
	depth. The plastic FEMs also exhibited an anomaly in the J-integral
	at the third and fourth angles from the surface. The anomaly could
	be taken as a jump at the third angle or a dip at the fourth angle,
	depending on how the data were trended. The third angle varied with
	the model geometry (2.71 degrees to 11.24 degrees).},

	Abstract = {A simple simulation of alternate growth of a small surface crack in
	the surface and depth directions was performed to illustrate the
	changes in crack aspect ratio, induced by grain boundaries, as a
	function of crack size. It is shown that at small crack sizes, large
	variations in aspect ratio, $a/c$ ($a$ is the crack depth and $c$
	is the half-surface length), occur, due to local crack front perturbations
	induced by grains that are oriented for crack growth. At these crack
	sizes, the assumption of a semicircular crack shape ($a/c = 1.0$)
	was found to cause errors in stress intensity range ($\Delta K$)
	calculations. This, in turn, led to significant scatter or 'anomaly'
	in small crack growth rates relative to large cracks. At large crack
	sizes, the effects of local crack front perturbations on crack aspect
	ratio and $\Delta K$ were found to be insignificant. As a result,
	the scatter in crack growth data was found to decrease to a negligible
	level at large crack sizes. It is suggested that the limiting crack
	size above which the small crack behaves as a large crack, $l_2 =
	10d$ ($d$ = grain size), proposed by Taylor and Knott, is related
	to the crack size above which the effects due to aspect ratio variations

	understand the growth characteristics of small surface cracks in

	on naturally initiated surface cracks in smooth specimens and large
	through cracks in CT specimens for four different microstructures.
	The microstructures investigated include the Widmanstatten basketweave
	structure, the aligned colony lamellar structure, the equiaxed $\alpha_2+\beta$
	structure and the completely equiaxed $\alpha_2$ structure. Small
	cracks were found to develop arbitrary shapes due to the influence
	of microstructure. The nature of crack shape (aspect ratio) development
	was found to depend on microstructure. The continuous changes in
	crack shape were monitored using a laser interferometric system and
	a photomicroscopic system. Growth rates of small cracks were calculated
	incorporating the variations in shape or aspect ratio. After accounting
	for these variations, the trends in small-crack growth rates agreed
	reasonably well with the corresponding large-crack growth rates.
	While the crack growth rates at depth positions for small cracks
	correlated well with large-crack data in the basketweave microstructure,
	crack growth rates at surface positions correlated well with the

	Abstract = {The effect of plate width on the initiation and propagation of fatigue
	cracks in plate-to-plate T-joints with load-carrying transverse attachment
	plates and flat fillet-like weld profiles was investigated in a series
	of constant amplitude fatigue tests. There was no observable effect
	of plate width on initiation life, propagation life, or total fatigue
	life, but plate width had a significant effect on crack shape development
	and crack growth rates. More cracks initiated along the weld toes
	of wider joints. As a result, the aspect ratios of dominant surface
	cracks were lower in wider joints, and the dominant surface cracks
	propagated faster through the thickness of wider base plates. However,
	there was a greater propensity for edge cracking in narrower specimens
	because fatigue cracks initiated closer to the free edges of such
	joints. This offset the faster growth of dominant surface cracks
	in wider joints so that there was no net effect of plate width on
	propagation life. A multiple crack linear elastic fracture mechanics
	model successfully simulated these differences in crack shape development
	behaviour.},
