\section{Load Separation Study}
\label{chap:load-separation}

\citet{sharobeamlandes1991,sharobeamlandes1994} demonstrated load separation for a variety of two-dimensional geometries, and also for surface cracks in tension, as noted in \Cref{sec:intro-load-separation}.
To date, there is no published literature regarding load separation applied to surface cracks in bending.
One part of the current research will use WARP3D to mimic a load separation experiment where separation parameters are calculated from curve fits of bending stress versus CMOD for a material with \(\frac{E}{\Sys}=500\) and \(n=4\).
A total of 20 models will be analyzed for load separation, covering all combinations of \(\frac{a}{c}\) and \(\frac{a}{t}\) used in the TASC database.
Similar to the \hone study in the previous section, these models will use identical meshes, reducing sources of error in later analysis.
