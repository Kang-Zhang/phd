	Abstract = {Abstract The well-known fitness-for-purpose (FFP) standard PD 6493:1991 has been revised and is now published as the British Standards Guide BS 7910. The revisions include modifications to the fracture and fatigue assessment clauses and many additional appendices have been added to complete the guidance provided. The PD 6539:1994 procedures for high temperature assessment have been incorporated as clause 9. This paper presents a brief historical review of the UK developments of FFP methods and outlines the modifications to BS 7910. In addition, the new BS 7910 fracture assessment clause is validated using a series of wide plate tests.},
